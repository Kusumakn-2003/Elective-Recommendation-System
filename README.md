# Elective-Recommendation-System

This project contains an “Elective Recommendation System” focused at providing guidance to students regarding selection of the best suited electives based on their previous academic records. The system consists of a backend developed using Flask together with the integration of the GPT API provided by OpenAI. As a foundation for understanding the strengths of students and the available elective courses, a database containing academic records of students is deposited.
